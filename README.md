# 3-Tier Architecture Network (NAT + DHCP + DNS + ACLs + L2 Security)

<img width="1920" height="902" alt="Topology" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84b13be9-0c30-46ce-a2f4-b9e8129b3784" />
<br>
Simplified collapsed core 3-tier network featuring NAT, DHCP, DNS, ACLs, L3 Routing, L2 switching, and L2 security via GNS3 VM. <br>

## Overview
Limitations: This topology contains single points of failure and lacks redundancy. Future improvements include adding dual devices, FHRP, and link redundancy.

This lab was built using Cisco Virtual IOS L2 (vIOS L2) switch images and Cisco 7200 IOS (C7200-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M) router images.

### This GNS3 project simulates a network with:

- NAT overload (PAT) for internet access
- ACLs to identify which traffic should be translated via PAT 
- DHCP services for internal subnets
- Layer 2 switching / Layer 3 routing 
- DHCP Snooping and Port Security (Sticky MAC)

## Network Design

### WAN

- Public block: 192.168.1.0/24

- Edge Router (NAT):
   - g0/0 = ISP (Network Adapter VMnet0 - Bridged)
   - g1/0 = Point-to-point Link with Distribution Router

### Internal Networks
  Network ---- Gateway ----
- 192.168.10.0/24 ---- 192.168.10.254 ---- 
- 192.168.20.0/24 ----	192.168.20.254 ---- 

### NAT + ACLs

#### Implemented on Edge Router

- NAT Inside: g1/0 <br>
- NAT Outside: g0/0 <br>

NAT Overload (PAT) using named ACLs: <br>
ip access-list standard PAT <br>
permit 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 <br>
permit 192.168.20.0 0.0.0.255 <br>

- ip nat inside source list PAT interface GigabitEthernet0/0 overload

### DHCP
#### Centralized on Distribution Router
- Excluded IP Addresses: 192.168.10.254 and 192.168.20.254
  - Reserved to keep static IP addresses on access switches.
- Pools:
   - POOL10: 192.168.10.0/24
      - DNS: 8.8.8.8
      - Domain: kelvin.lab.local
      - Default Gateway: 192.168.10.254
   - POOL20: 192.168.20.0/24
      - DNS: 8.8.8.8
      - Domain: kelvin.lab.local
      - Default Gateway: 192.168.20.254

### Layer 2 Security
- DHCP Snooping enabled
  - Trusted ports configured toward router/uplinks
  - Limit rate of 4 DHCP packets per second on untrusted ports (end-users)
- Port Security (Sticky MAC)
   - Enabled on switch ports connected to end-users
   - Maximum MAC addresses allowed on each switch: 2
   - Violation mode set to restrict 

### Features Implemented
- DHCP services
- NAT overload (PAT)
- DNS reachability
- L2 security protections against spoofing and unauthorized rogue device plug-ins
